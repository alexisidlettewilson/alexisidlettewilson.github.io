### The Challenge

The [Reddit DataIsBeautiful group](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) holds friendly, monthly data visualization competitions. Every month there the moderator presents new data sets and different challenges to be tackled by participants.

The August 2018 competition challenged participants to visualize United States (US) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data. 

### The Data

I chose an exploratory analysis asking the questions that immediately came to my mind when looking through the data.

The TSA data sets are available on the [US Department of Homeland Security website](https://www.dhs.gov/tsa-claims-data).

Some of the data sets are in Excel friendly formats but the last two years of data proved to be a challenge as they were provided in PDF format. After exploring options available through both R and Python, I chose the tabula pack to extract the data from the PDF into a table.
