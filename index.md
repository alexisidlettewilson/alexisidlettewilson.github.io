# About Me

I currently work as a Strategic Data Analyst in Jacksonville, FL where my work revolves around analytics for the contingent staffing space. I enjoy the logical thought process behind decision-making and you're like to find a rank-scoring table on my desktop for everything from professional development to places to go on vacation. I also have more than seven years as a business analyst and tend to approach challenges, personal and professional, with an analyst's perspective.
